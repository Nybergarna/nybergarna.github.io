                    <p>
                      The <strong>FastPlanAction</strong> function is the entry
                      point of the AI’s action planning. It takes in the current
                      <strong>WorldModel</strong> and a <strong>Goal</strong>,
                      then estimates the cost to reach the goal using a
                      heuristic. Based on this estimate, it searches for the
                      most efficient action by calling
                      <strong>DoFastDepthFirst</strong>, which explores possible
                      action sequences up to a defined depth. If a valid plan is
                      found within the cost limit, it returns the best action.
                      If not, it defaults to an idle action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To keep this planner running every frame or very often,
                      the depth has to be quite shallow.
                    </p>

                      <strong>DoFastDepthFirst</strong> performs a depth-limited
                      search through possible actions, guided by a heuristic. At
                      each depth level, it evaluates available actions,
                      simulates the results, and calculates the cost to reach
                      the goal. Actions that exceed the given cutoff are ignored
                      to keep the plan efficient. A
                      <strong>transposition table</strong>
                      is used to skip already visited states, preventing
                      redundant checks. The function returns the best
                      alternative cost and the first action in the most
                      promising sequence.

              </header>
              <p>
                <strong>Soldiers</strong>, <strong>Farmers</strong>, and
                <strong>Goblins</strong> emit influence on the grid around them.
                This influence spreads out in a radius with a decay rate,
                forming a dynamic heat map that represents presence. The
                influence map is used to guide movement and behavior:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Farmers</strong> avoid enemy influence while gathering
                  resources.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Soldiers</strong> move toward areas with high enemy
                  influence to engage or defend. If no enemy influence is
                  nearby, they prefer tiles with the lowest farmer influence,
                  effectively patrolling vulnerable zones. If no farmer
                  influence exists either, they move toward the nearest farmer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Goblins</strong> move randomly but avoid soldier
                  influence and prefer tiles with high farmer presence, giving
                  them unpredictable but purposeful movement.
                </li>

                      This function determines how soldiers choose their next
                      move using the influence map. Other soldier-occupied tiles
                      are filtered out first.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <strong>1.</strong> If enemies are nearby, the soldier
                        sorts possible moves by enemy influence, preferring the
                        tile with the highest threat to engage.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>2.</strong> If no enemies are nearby, it looks
                        for tiles with some farmer influence, then picks the one
                        with the lowest farmer presence. This creates a
                        border-patrol behavior, guarding less protected areas.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>3.</strong> If there’s no farmer influence at
                        all, it moves toward the closest farmer to stay near
                        important units.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Fallback:</strong> If no farmers exist, it picks
                        a random valid move.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      This creates a movement pattern where soldiers act
                      defensively, prioritize threats, and naturally position
                      themselves to protect the perimeter of farmer positions
                      while avoiding collisions with other soldiers.

                      2nd, 3rd, or 5th tile) to control
                      <strong>density</strong>.

                      <strong>map bounds</strong>, is <strong>walkable</strong>,
                      and not inside an <strong>exclusion zone</strong>.

                <h3>Finding the Right Focus</h3>
                <p>
                  One of the first challenges I faced was deciding what part of
                  game AI I wanted to explore. I knew I wanted to work with
                  <strong>AI systems in games</strong>, but I struggled to find
                  something that felt both complex and meaningful. I initially
                  came across the
                  <strong>Iterative Deepening A*</strong> algorithm and was
                  fascinated by how it differs from regular A*—it uses
                  significantly <strong>less memory</strong>, which makes it a
                  powerful tool in large data spaces with many actions, paths,
                  or tasks. The idea of building an AI planner that could work
                  in a sea of data and still find the optimal goal path really
                  appealed to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, the <strong>performance trade-offs</strong> became a
                  problem. The algorithm restarts its search whenever it exceeds
                  the current cost threshold, which added too much overhead for
                  my use case in a real-time game. I ended up modifying it,
                  steering the algorithm early on with a
                  <strong>manipulated cost function</strong> to find quicker
                  paths and skipping the repeated cutoff logic. This experience
                  taught me a lot about <strong>algorithm design</strong> and
                  how even small tweaks can drastically affect performance and
                  behavior.
                </p>

                <h3>Creating the Game World</h3>
                <p>
                  Because I decided to build an
                  <strong>RTS-style game</strong> around the GOAP system, I
                  needed assets that matched the idea. I found a free pixel art
                  library by
                  <style>
                    a.styled-link {
                      color: #1e90ff;
                      text-decoration: none;
                      border-bottom: 1px solid transparent;
                      transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
                    }

                    a.styled-link:hover {
                      border-bottom: 1px solid #1e90ff;
                    }
                  </style>

                  <a
                    href="https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/tiny-swords"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="styled-link"
                  >
                    Pixel Frog </a
                  >, which was perfect for giving the project a stylized look.
                  At the same time, building this game involved more than just
                  the GOAP logic—I also had to handle
                  <strong>terrain generation</strong>,
                  <strong>rendering systems</strong>, and a range of behaviors
                  unrelated to my AI focus.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thankfully, I managed to implement the action planner fairly
                  quickly. Once I had a working structure for
                  <strong>actions, goals, and costs</strong>, I had enough time
                  to expand the project. In many cases, I reused knowledge from
                  previous projects—like
                  <strong>grids, pathfinding,</strong> and
                  <strong>procedural generation</strong>. But I also had to
                  create new systems from scratch, like a simple
                  <strong>entity inheritance system</strong> and rules for
                  <strong>synchronized behaviors</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>AI Coordination</h3>
                <p>
                  One of my favorite challenges was coordinating different AI
                  roles—<strong>farmers, guards,</strong> and
                  <strong>goblins</strong>. I wanted farmers to act based on the
                  GOAP system, focusing on their tasks while avoiding danger.
                  Guards needed to protect them dynamically, while goblins would
                  target unprotected farmers. This led me to explore concepts
                  like <strong>influence maps</strong> and heat-based grid
                  scoring.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I developed a system where each entity would scan nearby grid
                  tiles and sort them based on a combination of
                  <strong>influence values</strong> and
                  <strong>distance to goal</strong>. This created more
                  believable movement and less rigid behavior. It also had a
                  positive impact on <strong>performance</strong>, since not
                  every agent had to run a full pathfinding routine at every
                  step. Instead, entities appeared to explore their surroundings
                  more naturally.
                </p>

                <h3>Planner Limitations & Missed Opportunities</h3>
                <p>
                  One thing I didn’t get around to improving was how the action
                  planner handles future resource gains. Right now, it only
                  plans based on the <strong>current world state</strong>. So
                  if, for example, three farmers are already out gathering food,
                  the planner doesn’t consider that upcoming food—it only reacts
                  after the world state has actually changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In hindsight, it would’ve been great to add a layer of
                  <strong>predictive planning</strong>. For instance, estimating
                  the chance of incoming resources based on whether a farmer is
                  carrying food back to base and not in danger. That way, the
                  planner could make smarter decisions without waiting for a
                  full update. Time constraints kept me from exploring it, but
                  it's something I’d definitely like to implement in future
                  projects.
                </p>

                <h3>Final Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                  In the end, I had essentially created my own small simulation
                  game. This project gave me valuable insights into how to
                  <strong>structure gameplay systems</strong> around AI, and how
                  to make smart trade-offs between performance and behavior. I
                  learned how important it is to scope your project
                  carefully—while I’m proud of what I built, I realized that if
                  my main goal was to specialize in AI, I could’ve chosen a
                  system with fewer distractions outside of the core logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That said, the experience of combining
                  <strong>GOAP planning</strong> with
                  <strong>influence-based movement</strong> and entity
                  interaction gave me a strong foundation for future AI systems.
                  It helped me grow both as a programmer and as a systems
                  thinker.
